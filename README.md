# DNA_methylation_EPIC_v2.0_beadchip_data_analysis
DNA methylation analysis for the data generated from Illumina infinium EPIC v2.0 beadchip
Here we are using the combination of minfi, and ChAMP for making this pipeline
This pipeline have included the celll type heterogenity correction for the previous version of the chip illumina EPIC v1.0, better to avoid it from analysis
Because the cell type heterogenity correction is not validated till now for the Illumina EPIC v2.0 beadchip

This pipeline is designed for DNA methylation analysis of data generated using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 BeadChip. It leverages a combination of the minfi and ChAMP R packages to perform preprocessing, normalization, and downstream analysis. Unlike previous pipelines developed for the EPIC v1.0 array, this workflow does not include cell type heterogeneity correction, as existing correction methods have not yet been validated for the EPIC v2.0 platform. Users are advised to avoid applying cell composition adjustment until robust validation methods for this version become available.
